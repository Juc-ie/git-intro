    <p>The Zoo is an amazing place with lots of animals and familys to have fun and explore wild life in other parts of the world you may never see and have lots of fun playing, watching, and even DANCING!! We love to play and dance at the zoo with the animals to make them super happy and exited it makes them feel very loved when they dance to party music just don let them drink the secret warter or they might get a little crazy mainly at night thingd get scary hehehehe.
